# Week 1
## Introduction to Recommender Systems

Lecture by [Kirill Khrylchenko](https://github.com/KhrylchenkoKirill)

In the first week of the course, we provide a gentle introduction to recommender systems:
1. Information Overload --- why we use recommender systems and what value they bring to both users and content creators.
2. What do we optimize? --- introducing the third stakeholder, the platform: the engineers and product teams behind the recommender system, and what drives their decisions (spoiler: revenue).
3. Recommender algorithms under the hood --- a recommender system is essentially a large-scale sorting problem. We discuss several simple algorithms that help build intuition about how modern recommenders work.
4. Whe do we need neural nets? --- discussing the Bitter Lesson, scaling trends, cold start, the long tail, and distribution drift.
5. Transformer Recommenders --- a brief preview of upcoming lectures, where we explore how transformer architectures can be adapted for recommendation tasks.

The seminar covers two practical topics that are essential for any recommender systems practitioner:
1. How do we reliably evaluate recommender systems offline?
2. What does the data actually look like, and how do we work with it?
